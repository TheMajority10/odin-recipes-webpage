        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4></li>
            <p>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees 
                F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</p>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4></li>
            <p>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling 
                boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling 
                mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the 
                mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and 
                beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a 
                pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</p>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
            <p>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into 
                the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, 
                about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on 
                paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll 
                churros in the mixture while still hot.</p>
